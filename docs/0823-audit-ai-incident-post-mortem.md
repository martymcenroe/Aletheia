# 0823 - Audit: AI Incident Post-Mortem

## 1. Purpose

Structured process for analyzing AI system failures, near-misses, and unexpected behaviors. Captures lessons learned, identifies root causes, and drives systemic improvements. Based on NIST AI RMF GOVERN and MANAGE functions, adapted from SRE incident management practices.

**Aletheia Context:**
- AI-generated etymology errors
- Guardrail failures (false positives/negatives)
- Prompt injection attempts
- Claude Code workflow incidents
- Production outages affecting AI components

---

## 2. Incident Classification

### 2.1 Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition | Examples | Response Time |
|----------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **SEV-1** | Critical - safety or security breach | User data exposed, harmful content generated | Immediate |
| **SEV-2** | High - significant user impact | Service down, major feature broken | < 4 hours |
| **SEV-3** | Medium - degraded experience | Slow responses, minor errors | < 24 hours |
| **SEV-4** | Low - minor issues | Cosmetic bugs, edge cases | < 1 week |

### 2.1.1 Automatic Severity Indicators (MANDATORY)

**Agent classification is a SUGGESTION. Human confirms final severity.**

The following keywords/patterns trigger AUTOMATIC severity floors:

| Trigger | Auto-Minimum | Rationale |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| "user data", "PII", "credentials", "password" | SEV-1 | Privacy breach |
| "security", "breach", "exploit", "injection" | SEV-1 | Security incident |
| "harmful", "offensive", "slur", "hate" | SEV-1 | Safety failure |
| "data loss", "corruption", "deleted" | SEV-1 | Data integrity |
| "service down", "outage", "unavailable" | SEV-2 | Availability |
| "bypass", "circumvent", "evade" | SEV-2 | Control failure |

**Classification Override Rules:**

1. Agent proposes severity based on assessment
2. If any auto-trigger keyword is present, severity CANNOT be lower than the trigger floor
3. Human can escalate (SEV-3 → SEV-1) but agent cannot downgrade below auto-floor
4. All severity classifications must be documented with rationale

**Example:**
- Incident: "Prompt injection bypassed guardrail"
- Keyword triggers: "injection" (SEV-1), "bypass" (SEV-2)
- Auto-floor: SEV-1 (highest trigger wins)
- Agent cannot classify this as SEV-3 or SEV-4

### 2.2 AI-Specific Incident Types

| Type | Description | Typical Severity |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Safety Failure** | Harmful content generated/passed | SEV-1 |
| **Privacy Breach** | User data exposed/logged | SEV-1 |
| **Model Error** | Incorrect/nonsensical output | SEV-3 |
| **Guardrail Bypass** | Content filter circumvented | SEV-2 |
| **Prompt Injection** | Malicious prompt succeeded | SEV-2 |
| **Availability** | AI service unavailable | SEV-2/3 |
| **Performance** | Slow or timeout responses | SEV-3 |
| **Agent Misbehavior** | Claude Code unexpected action | SEV-2/3 |
