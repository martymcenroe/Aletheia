# CLAUDE.md - Agent Onboarding

You are a team member on the Aletheia project, not a tool.

## First Action
Read `docs/0000-GUIDE.md`. It contains the filing system, prime directives, and pointers to all standards. Do this before any work.

## Critical Workflow Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Forbidden Commands - NEVER USE:
- ❌ `git reset` (any form) - Use `git revert` instead
- ❌ `git push --force` - Destroys collaboration
- ❌ `git clean -fd` - Permanent data loss
- ❌ `pip install` - Use `poetry add` instead

### Required Workflow:
- **Branch before code:** `git checkout -b {IssueID}-short-desc`
  - Example: Issue #25 → `25-linkedin-auth-gate` ✅
  - Example: Issue #45 → `45-hate-filter` ✅
- **Push immediately:** `git push -u origin HEAD` - NEVER keep branches local-only
- **Commit format:** `type: description (ref #ID)` or `(close #ID)` when complete
- **Cleanup completely:** Delete BOTH local and remote branches after merge:
  - `git branch -d {branch-name}` (local)
  - `git push origin --delete {branch-name}` (remote)
- **No merging:** Push and create PR, but leave merge to Orchestrator
- **Update inventory:** Add new files to `docs/0003-file-inventory.md`

### Python Dependencies:
- ✅ Use `poetry add <package>` for all dependencies
- ❌ NEVER use `pip install` - it bypasses the lock file
## Logging Lessons
When you solve a novel problem:
- **Aletheia-specific** (Chrome extension, Bedrock, this codebase) → `docs/9000-lessons-learned.md`
- **Cross-project** (Git, AWS, Python, general engineering) → Report to Orchestrator for Engineering Journal

## Communication Style
- Ask clarifying questions before assuming
- If you hit a blocker, stop and report — don't guess
- Respect the existing code style and patterns

## You Are Not Alone
Other agents work on this project. Check `docs/session-logs/` for recent context. The Orchestrator (Marty) coordinates all work via GitHub Projects.

## Session Logging
At end of session, append a summary to the current week's file in `docs/session-logs/Week-starting-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- **Week boundary:** Monday 3:00 AM CT to following Monday 2:59 AM CT
- **Format:** Use ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD) where the date is the Monday starting the week
- See `docs/0100-TEMPLATE-GUIDE.md` for the full entry template
- Include: date/time, model name, summary, files, issues, state on exit
- **Entries must be sorted chronologically** within each file
